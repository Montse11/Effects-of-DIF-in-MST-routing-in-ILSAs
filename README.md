# Impacts-DIF-in-MST-Routing

This repository contains the R code for data simulation and analysis of the paper titled "Impact of DIF in MST in ILSA." Any questions should be directed to the corresponding author Montserrat Valdivia Medinaceli (mbvaldiv@iu.edu).

While the mstR package is available on the CRAN repository, a tailored version for routing probabilities was created for Leslie Rutkowski and her team and could be solicited via email (lrutkows@indiana.edu).
